/// Implementations must be `Send + Sync` so the service can be shared across
/// Actix worker threads via `Arc<dyn RateLimitStore>`.
///
/// Three backends are provided in `batlehub-adapters`:
/// - [`InMemoryRateLimitStore`] — single-process, lost on restart
/// - [`PgRateLimitStore`] — persisted in PostgreSQL, shared across instances
/// - [`RedisRateLimitStore`] — persisted in Redis (feature `cache-redis`), shared across instances

    ///
    /// The window is aligned to the Unix epoch: `window_start = floor(now / window_secs) * window_secs`.
    /// Each unique `(key, window_start)` pair gets its own independent counter.
    ///
    /// Returns `(new_count, window_reset_unix_secs)` where `window_reset_unix_secs` is the Unix
    /// timestamp at which the current window closes and the counter resets to zero.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `CoreError` if the backend is unavailable or `window_secs` is zero.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// Implementations must not panic; `window_secs == 0` must return an error.
