/// four things the previous design had none of: the `code_verifier` never
/// reaches the browser (PKCE is meaningless otherwise), the callback can only be
/// redeemed once, an abandoned login expires, and the provider is decided by the
/// server rather than by a string the caller controls.
///
/// It does **not** bind the flow to a particular browser — the store cannot tell
/// two browsers apart. That binding is the `spa_state` round trip: the caller
/// generates a value, keeps it in `sessionStorage` (browser) or memory (CLI),
/// and compares it against the one echoed back at the end. Both layers are
/// needed, and neither substitutes for the other.
