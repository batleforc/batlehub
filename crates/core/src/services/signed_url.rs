//! Signed, expiring, single-coordinate download URLs (RFC 0012).
//!
//! Terraform authenticates the two JSON documents of a provider install and
//! then fetches the provider archive — and its `SHA256SUMS` and `.sig` — **with
//! no `Authorization` header**. That is not a misconfiguration: the client has
//! no mechanism to send one on those requests. Measured against Terraform 1.8.5
//! (RFC 0012 §11): every protocol document is authenticated, all nine artifact
//! fetches in the probe were not, including on the host authenticated one
//! request earlier.
//!
//! The consequence today is that a Terraform mirror needs
//! `anonymous = ["releases:read", "source:read"]`, which is per *registry* — so
//! opening the last step of one provider install opens every read on it.
//!
//! This module mints a signature **inside the document that was already
//! authenticated**, and verifies it on the credential-less follow-up. It
//! authenticates a request; it authorises nothing. The identity recovered from
//! a valid signature is handed to the same rule chain, quota and audit as an
//! identity recovered from a header — see RFC 0012 §6.6. In particular a
//! blocked version stays blocked for a URL minted before the block, because the
//! block is evaluated at redemption rather than at minting.
//!
//! ## Why HMAC and not Ed25519
//!
//! Asymmetric signing buys a verifier that does not hold the secret, and here
//! the verifier *is* the minter. It would cost a larger token and a slower
//! verify for a property nothing needs. HMAC-SHA256 over the `sha2` already in
//! the tree also stays clear of the `rsa` family that `deny.toml` bans
//! (RUSTSEC-2023-0071).
