//! `package_statuses` row, increments no download count, touches no
//! `last_accessed`, consumes no quota, creates no storage entry, and does not
//! make the package appear in the catalogue. A page view must not be able to

//! console silently rewrites the inventory an operator reads to make decisions
//! (§4.4).
//!
//! Nothing new leaves that the proxy would not otherwise fetch: the request is
//! the same version document a package manager pointed at this registry causes
//! on its first resolve, to the same host, through the same client, with the
