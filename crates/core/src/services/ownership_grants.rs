//! Ownership, projected into package-tier grants.
//!
//! RFC 0015 §10 rule 9: *"Ownership rows migrate to package-level grants —
//! `releases:publish`, `owners:read` and `owners:write` on the one package,
//! which is the scope `OwnershipPort` already has."* Migration 042 moved the
//! rows that existed; this keeps them in step from then on.
//!
//! # Why a decorator and not a call in each handler
//!
//! Ownership changes through five doors: a first publish, the two admin
//! governance routes, the two `cargo owner` routes, and the name release when a
//! package's last version is deleted. The first of those was written through and
//! the other four were not, so `package_owners` and `grants` diverged from the
//! first owner change on any estate — a removed owner kept a package-tier
//! `releases:publish` and `owners:write` grant permanently, and `explain`
//! reported it as live.
//!
//! Adding the projection to each door would be four call sites and a fifth that
//! a later contributor forgets, which is *"authorization by convention rather
//! than by construction"* — the sentence §2 opens with. Wrapping the port
//! instead means every caller gets it because there is no other port to call:
//! handlers reach ownership through `LocalRegistryService::ownership`, and what
//! is behind that handle is this.
//!
//! [`OwnershipGrants::wrap`] is therefore the one constructor, and both
//! `server/src/main.rs` and the test fixtures call it. §13.5 records why that
//! matters more than it sounds: when `RbacRule` came out of the chain, a fixture
//! that kept building the rule while production resolved grants went on passing
//! while testing a path nobody ran.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! Not the enforcement path. `can_publish` still decides who may publish to an
//! existing package, for the reason §13.5 gives at length: ownership **narrows**
//! and §4.3's union only widens, so reading these rows as the authority would let
//! any user publish over any other user's package. These grants are the *read*
//! model — what the owners API is a view over, and what `explain` reports.
