//! Listings filter, they do not refuse.
//!
//! RFC 0015 §4.4. A caller holding `releases:list` on a namespace but
//! `releases:read` on only some of its packages asks for a version index. The
//! index returns **what they may see**, not `403`.
//!
//! This is not a new mechanism. It is the one [RFC 0006] already established for
//! administrative blocks: a blocked version is removed from the listing so the
//! resolver routes past it, which is why the Maven and NuGet handlers reach for
//! `proxy_document` rather than `proxy_stream` on their index routes —
//! streaming would deliver a document with the blocked version still in it, and
//! the build would pick that version and fail at download. Grants filter the
//! same document at the same point, for the same reason.
//!
//! [RFC 0006]: https://batleforc.git.batleforc.fr/batlehub/rfc/0006-blocked-versions-hidden-everywhere
//!
//! # The three rules, and which of them live here
//!
//! 1. **Filter in the query, never after it.** Totals and pagination are
//!    computed on the filtered set. That one belongs to each listing's own
//!    query — a helper cannot enforce it, and [`FilterOutcome::total`] exists so
//!    a caller cannot accidentally report a count from before the filter.
//! 2. **Two levels, two answers.** No grant on the *package* → answer as though
//!    it does not exist. A grant on the package but not on every version →
//!    return the filtered list. [`PackageVisibility`] is that decision, made
//!    once so no handler has to remember which way round it goes.
//! 3. **A filtered listing is identity-dependent and must never be cached under
//!    an identity-blind key.** [`GrantSet::cache_key`] is the key it must be
//!    cached under instead.
//!
//! # What of this is live, and what is waiting for a writer
//!
//! Audited 2026-09-01, because the answer is not uniform across the module and a
//! reader who assumes either way gets it wrong.
//!
//! **Live.** [`Readable`] and its builders — [`Readable::from_registry`],
//! [`Readable::needs_package_grants`], [`Readable::with_package_grants`] — are
//! how `LocalRegistryService` scopes every whole-registry document
//! (`local_registry/read.rs`). Package-tier grants are real and written at
//! runtime: the ownership API puts them (`services/ownership_grants.rs`), and
//! migration 042 seeded them from the ownership rows that predate the model. So
//! rule 2's first half — *no grant on the package → answer as though it does not
//! exist* — is enforced, and so is the filtering of documents that span many
//! packages.
//!
//! **Waiting for a writer.** [`filter_listing`] and [`package_visibility`] have
//! no caller. They are rule 2's *second* half — *a grant on the package but not
//! on every version → return the filtered list* — and that state cannot be
//! reached today for one narrow reason: **nothing writes a version-tier grant.**
//! Everything else on that path exists and is live — the `grants` table's
//! `node_kind = 'version'` (migration 041), [`version_node_key`](crate::ports::version_node_key), the
//! `grants_for(registry, package, version)` read on the hot path in
//! `chain::stored_nodes` — but every `put_grant` call site in the tree writes
//! `NodeKind::Package`. With no version row to differ from the package answer,
//! a caller's `releases:read` verdict is uniform across every version, so the
//! package-tier decision *is* the whole answer and a per-version filter would
//! remove nothing.
//!
//! **The day a version-tier grant becomes writable, these two become
//! load-bearing** — and the failure would be silent: version indexes would keep
//! listing versions the caller may not read, the download gate would keep
//! refusing them one at a time, and what leaks is the existence and the numbers
//! rather than the bytes. Rule 3 arrives in the same commit: a listing that
//! filters is identity-dependent, and every cache in front of one needs
//! [`GrantSet::cache_key`](crate::entities::GrantSet::cache_key) from that point
//! on.
//!
//! # Why filtering only bites when the broad tier is narrow
//!
//! Grants only widen (§4.3), so a caller who holds `releases:read` at the
//! registry tier holds it on every package beneath — and filtering removes
//! nothing. That is correct and worth stating, because it is easy to mistake for
//! the filter not working: the filter is meaningful exactly when the registry or
//! namespace tier grants `releases:list` **without** `releases:read`, and the
//! deeper tiers grant the read on the packages this caller may see. §4.4's
//! opening sentence describes precisely that configuration.

///   seal narrows it. The contract sentence this function used to carry already
///   said so — "the tiers that are constant across the document ... the
///   registry **and namespace** tiers" — and the call site did not.
/// - **`releases:list`.** A different verb from `releases:read`, resolved over
///   the same hierarchy: `check_read_access` runs `authorize_listing` on it
///   before the read set is consulted, so two callers with the same read set
///   and different list sets get different documents.
/// - **`private` visibility (§4.5).** It drops everything inherited and admits
///   only a grant written *on the package*. Two callers that
///   [`Readable::Everything`] collapses — both hold the read at the registry
///   tier, neither has anything to filter — are still entitled to different
///   documents, because only one of them holds the grant written on the private
///   package. That is why `local_read_grants` is carried separately rather than
///   read back out of `readable`: the fast path does not fetch it.
/// - **`team` visibility and the beta channel.** Group membership and channel
///   membership. No grant resolves either, and both remove packages and
///   versions from what a caller may see.
///
/// Each is a route by which one caller's document is replayed to another —
/// finding 11 again, on the surface §4.4 warns is easiest to forget.
