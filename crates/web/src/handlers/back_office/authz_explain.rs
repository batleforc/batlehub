//! `GET /api/v1/admin/authz/explain` — why the resolver decided that.
//!
//! RFC 0015 §4.8. Every mechanism this RFC removes had its own way of being
//! invisible: ownership lived in a table nobody rendered, `bypass_roles` was a
//! field inside a rule, the beta channel was a config block, and the only way to
//! answer "why was this refused?" was to read Rust. A single model deserves a
//! single place to watch it, and without one an operator's first encounter with
//! a denial is still a support ticket.
//!
//! §13 puts this in **phase 3**, not phase 5, and says why: *"the first thing
//! anyone asks of a grant resolver is why it did that, and a migration (§10)
//! reviewed without it is reviewed by reading code."*
//!
//! # `granted_by` is the point
//!
//! A resolved set without provenance tells an operator *what* they have. Naming
//! the tier **and the subject form** that produced each verb tells them which
//! line to edit — which is the difference between a debugging tool and a
//! diagnostic.
//!
//! # This resolves; it does not perform
//!
//! Nothing is fetched, nothing is written, no audit row is recorded for the
//! resource named. That makes it a second implementation of the thing it
//! describes, and §11.6 is explicit about the risk: *"a diagnostic that can
//! disagree with reality is worse than none, because it is trusted."* So it is
//! tested as an **oracle** rather than on its own — `authz_explain_oracle.rs`
//! asserts its verdict against the verdict the real request received, for every
//! row of the authorization matrix.
//!
//! # Why the query is not a single `resource=`
//!
//! §4.8 writes `?subject=…&action=…&resource=…`. The first two are taken
//! literally; the third is split into `registry`, `package` and `version`,
//! because a package name contains the separator a single string would have to
//! be split on — `@acme/billing/cards` for npm, `example.com/team/lib` for Go.
//! `authz_matrix.rs` records the same hazard one layer down, where a
//! hand-written route matcher got path parameters wrong in both directions
//! because "a path parameter is not always a single segment".
