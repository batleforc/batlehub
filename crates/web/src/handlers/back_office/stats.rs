/// The registries this caller holds `stats:read` on (RFC 0015 §4.2), or a `403`
/// when that is none of them.
///
/// # Refuse at nothing, filter at some
///
/// `stats:read` is one of the three disclosure verbs §4.2 splits out of
/// `require_admin`, and §7 is explicit that doing so *"is a reduction in
/// privilege for existing admins and must not be applied silently"*. §10 rule 5
/// is what makes that safe: the verb goes to `role:admin` on every registry, so
/// an administrator's dashboard is unchanged on upgrade and the verb becomes
/// **grantable** rather than newly required.
///
/// The boundary is §4.4 rule 2 applied one level up, and it has two sides that
/// are easy to collapse into one:
///
/// - **Held nowhere → `403`.** The caller asserted nothing and is told so. This
///   is what `require_admin` answered before, so an anonymous or ordinary-user
///   request to this endpoint is refused exactly as it is today — which is
///   §10's whole promise, and what the pre-existing tests pin.
/// - **Held somewhere → filter.** *"`stats:read` without any package grants
///   therefore resolves to a dashboard of zeroes rather than a `403` … the
///   caller asked for their own view, and their own view is empty."* An operator
///   who grants it on one registry gets that registry's numbers and nothing for
///   the rest, not a refusal for the whole page.
///
/// Reading the second rule as covering the first would turn an admin-only
/// endpoint into one that answers `200` to anonymous. It would disclose nothing
/// — the filtered result is empty — but a surface that answers everybody is a
/// different surface, and this document does not widen one by accident.
