//! The npm CLI surface that was not a package read.
//!
//! RFC 0009 §7.1 (rest). `npm whoami`, `npm ping` and `npm dist-tag` had no
//! routes — and the first two did not fail cleanly. They were eaten by the
//! three-segment catch-all `/proxy/{registry}/{package}/{version}` and answered
//! **`200 OK` with an npm version document**: `whoami` taken for package `-`
//! at version `whoami`. A wrong answer under a success status, which nothing
//! downstream can detect. `protocol_conformance.rs` found it on its first run
//! and pinned it until this phase.
//!
//! ## dist-tags is a listing
//!
//! `dist-tags` maps tag → version, so a tag naming a blocked version hands the
//! client a version it cannot have — the same failure a packument listing a
//! blocked version causes, in three lines of JSON instead of three hundred.
//!
//! It is not filtered *here*, though: `npm_dist_tags` reads the map out of the
//! packument, which `blocking::npm::strip_packument` has already repaired
//! against the blocked set. One filter, two documents, and no way for them to
//! disagree — a second filter over the same facts is a second thing to keep in
//! step.
