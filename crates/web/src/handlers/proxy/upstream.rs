//! The one place under `handlers/proxy/` that makes an outbound HTTP call.
//!
//! RFC 0009 §4.2. Every passthrough used to build its own `reqwest` call —
//! `forward_npm_audit`, the Go vulnerability database's `forward_get`, NuGet's
//! vulnerability pages — with no cache read and no cache write. So each failed
//! outright the moment its upstream was unreachable, including when we had
//! answered the identical request a minute earlier, and
//! `docs/use/vulnerability-proxy.md` presented all three as proxied features. A
//! vulnerability check that fails closed on upstream loss is the one most
//! likely to be running in a pipeline that must not stop.
//!
//! Routing every passthrough through here is the enforcement: the next one
//! inherits the three rungs by having nowhere else to go. The rungs themselves
//! are [`ProxyService::cached_passthrough`], which owns the policy; this module
//! owns only the transport, because core does not know what HTTP is.
