//! `/api/v1/me/*` — what this API can tell a caller about themselves.
//!
//! Every endpoint here is scoped to the token that made the request and takes
//! no `user_id` parameter of any kind. That is deliberate and load-bearing: an
//! endpoint that accepts a subject is an endpoint one missing authorisation
//! check away from serving someone else's data, which is why RFC 0004 §7 keeps
//! these paths and the admin ones separate rather than widening the admin
//! handlers to two authorisation rules.
//!
//! The scoping itself lives further down — in `PackageRepository::list_own_downloads`
//! and `OwnershipPort::list_owned_by` — so a future caller cannot assemble the
//! query without it (RFC 0004 §6.2).
