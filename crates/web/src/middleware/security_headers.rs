//! Baseline security response headers, applied to every response.
//!
//! BatleHub serves three very different things from one origin: the admin SPA
//! (which holds bearer tokens in `localStorage`), the JSON API, and artifact
//! bytes that outsiders control — raw repository files, npm tarballs, `.vsix`
//! bundles. Same-origin is what makes that combination worth hardening: anything
//! the browser can be talked into *rendering* from an artifact URL runs with the
//! SPA's origin, and therefore its storage.
//!
//! Three headers, chosen because they are unconditionally safe for all three
//! surfaces:
//!
//! - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — the important one. Stops the browser
//!   second-guessing the declared `Content-Type`, which is what turns an artifact
//!   containing HTML into a document. Pairs with `proxy_stream`'s
//!   `application/octet-stream` default; either alone leaves a gap.
//! - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — no part of this app is meant to be framed, so
//!   clickjacking against the admin UI has no legitimate use case to preserve.
//! - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` — package coordinates are in the path, and
//!   registry URLs are often internal. Nothing here should leak to a third party
//!   through a `Referer`.
//!
//! `nosniff` is load-bearing but narrow: it stops a browser second-guessing a
//! declared type, and does **nothing** when a handler legitimately declares
//! `text/html`. The PyPI Simple index does exactly that, from this origin, with
//! publisher-controlled strings in it — so `/proxy/**` gets a CSP of its own,
//! [`protocol_document_csp`]. See its docs for why that scope is the right one
//! and why the objections to a *global* policy do not reach it.
//!
//! **Deliberately not set here:**
//!
//! - `Strict-Transport-Security` — TLS terminates at the ingress; the server
//!   itself usually speaks plaintext HTTP, and emitting HSTS from behind a
//!   proxy is how you pin a browser to `https://` for a host that cannot serve
//!   it. Set it on the ingress instead (the chart's `ingress.annotations`
//!   carries a documented example).
//! - `Content-Security-Policy` — it cannot be global, because the three things
//!   this origin serves need three different policies: `/proxy/**` gets
//!   [`PROTOCOL_DOCUMENT_CSP`], `/scalar` gets [`API_DOCS_CSP`] (same
//!   `script-src 'self'`, but it needs `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` for a
//!   stylesheet the API reference builds at runtime, which the sandboxed proxy
//!   policy must not grant), and the SPA gets its own. It also cannot be
//!   attached to the
//!   static-file service, because `actix_files::Files` is not a
//!   `ServiceFactory` and takes no middleware. The SPA therefore declares its
//!   policy in a
//!   `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` tag, built at build time by
//!   `ui/build/csp.ts` so `connect-src` can track the configured API origin —
//!   and *narrowed to the running config* when the document is served, by
//!   `crate::spa`, which can subtract sources but never add one.
//!   `frame-ancestors` is ignored in meta form, which is precisely why
//!   `X-Frame-Options` is sent here for every response.
//!
//! [`DefaultHeaders`] only inserts a header the response does not already carry,
//! so a handler that sets its own value (the OIDC callback's stricter
//! `Referrer-Policy`, for instance) keeps it.
