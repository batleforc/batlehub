//! Serving the console's own document, and narrowing its policy to the config.
//!
//! # Why the server touches the CSP at all
//!
//! The policy is built by `ui/build/csp.ts` and substituted into a
//! `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` at **build time**, for two
//! reasons that have not changed: it must not apply to `/scalar`, whose bundle
//! comes from a CDN, and `actix_files::Files` is not a `ServiceFactory`, so it
//! can carry no header of its own.
//!
//! What that leaves is a policy frozen at `pnpm build`, describing a
//! configuration nobody has chosen yet. One source in it is config-dependent:
//! `https://badge.socket.dev`, admitted so the socket.dev badge can load. It is
//! a per-registry feature flag, so an instance that turns it off everywhere
//! still shipped a document announcing a third-party origin it will never call
//! — a wider policy than the deployment needs, which is the one direction a CSP
//! must never drift (RFC 0013 §7, §11 O5).
//!
//! # The rule: this can only subtract
//!
//! The built policy is the **maximum**. This module reads the document as built
//! and removes sources the running config makes unnecessary; it has no vocabulary
//! for adding one. That is deliberate and is the whole reason the narrowing lives
//! here rather than in a second policy builder written in Rust:
//!
//!  - there is exactly one definition of what the console may load, and it is the
//!    TypeScript one the browser already gets in dev;
//!  - no config value, however wrong, can open something the build did not allow;
//!  - a deployment whose `index.html` predates this code serves its policy
//!    unchanged rather than failing.
//!
//! [`narrow_csp`] is a pure function over the document text, and its tests assert
//! the subset property directly rather than the resulting string.

// exists in the console's router and nowhere on disk, so `actix_files` answered
// it with `404` — which made every URL RFC 0013 spent eleven phases turning into
// a destination unusable the moment it was pasted into a fresh tab, reloaded, or
// bookmarked. The `?version=`, `?q=` and `?page=` work only if the path they hang
// off resolves at all.
//
// The fallback is where an SPA server is most likely to do harm, so it is narrow
// on purpose. **Serving this document to a package manager would be worse than
// the 404 it replaces**: a client that asked for a missing artifact and got
// `200 text/html` gets a parse error, or worse, treats markup as a package. Four
// conditions, each of which can only make the fallback answer less often.

/// Paths this server itself owns. Anything under them must keep answering as it
/// did — a `404` from the API is an API answer, not a place to put the console.
///
/// Enumerated from the routes registered in `crates/web/src/handlers`, and short
/// by construction: the registry protocols all live under `/proxy/{registry}/…`,
