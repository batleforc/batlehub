//! The whole-registry document cache must not replay one caller's document to
//! another (RFC 0015 §4.4 rule 3).
//!
//! The key used to be `resolve(&[grants.registry], subject)` — the registry node
//! alone — while the document is filtered by four further identity-dependent
//! things: the instance and namespace tiers, `releases:list`, per-package
//! visibility (`team` group membership and `private`'s package-written grants),
//! and beta-channel membership. Two callers who agreed on that one node and on
//! nothing else shared an entry, and the first one in decided what the second
//! was served.
//!
//! `filter.rs`'s `document_key_tests` assert the key distinguishes each of those
//! dimensions. This file asserts the *server* does, through the routes a
//! `bundle install` actually calls, with the cache switched on — because a key
//! that is correct in isolation and a call site that passes it the wrong
//! resolution is precisely the shape of the bug (`cached_document`'s own
//! contract sentence named the namespace tier while the call site did not).
//!
//! Beta-channel membership is the dimension exercised here because it is the one
//! that no grant resolves at all: both callers hold `Action::ALL` at the registry
//! tier, so their grant sets are *identical* and the old key is *byte-identical*
//! for the two of them. Nothing about the disclosure is peculiar to beta
//! channels; it is the cleanest way to hold every other variable still.
//!
//! See `tests/common/mod.rs` for the shared app-factory infrastructure.
