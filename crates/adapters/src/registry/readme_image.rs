//! The [`ReadmeImageFetcher`] the server wires in (RFC 0007-bis §5.1).
//!
//! One client for every registry rather than one per registry, because an image
//! host is a third party by construction: it is not the configured upstream, so
//! none of a registry's credentials, custom headers or CA certificates apply to
//! it, and a per-registry client would only make it look as though they did.
//!
//! It does honour the operator's **proxy** settings, which is the one upstream
//! option that is about this network rather than about that registry — an
//! instance whose egress goes through a corporate proxy has to reach a badge CDN
//! through it too.
