//! Integration tests for the retention run against a real database and a real
//! store (RFC 0016 §10).
//!
//! # What is here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! *Which versions survive* is arithmetic over a policy and three facts about a
//! version, and it is asserted exhaustively in
//! `crates/core/src/services/retention/tests.rs` against in-memory doubles.
//! Repeating any of it here would buy nothing, so this file does not: there is no
//! `keep_for` test, no `keep_yanked` test, no floor-date test, and no
//! "refuses without a download signal" test.
//!
//! What is here is the set of claims the doubles **cannot** make, because each one
//! is a statement about SQL rather than about the decision:
//!
//! | Claim | Why a double cannot make it |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | The download signal round-trips | `last_downloads` filters `action = 'download' AND outcome = 'allowed'` — string literals that have to agree with what `action_to_str` and `record_access` *write*. The core double reimplements that filter in Rust (its own comment says "the same three constraints the Postgres query applies"), so the two can drift and every core test stays green while retention reads nothing. |
//! | The sidecar split survives the round-trip | Same seam, from the other side: `is_verification_sidecar` picks `ViewMetadata`, which becomes `'view_metadata'` in a column the query excludes by name. |
//! | `DISTINCT ON` returns the *newest* pull | `ORDER BY package_version, created_at DESC` is real SQL. Reversed, it returns a version's oldest pull, and an actively-used version reads as stale. The double uses a max over a `HashMap` and cannot have this bug. |
//! | `keep_versions` keeps the newest N | The weakest entry here, and it is kept deliberately. Both halves are already guarded separately — `local_registry.rs`'s `get_versions_returns_in_published_at_order` pins the adapter's `ORDER BY published_at ASC`, and the core suite pins the `total - 1 - i` rank arithmetic against its own double. Nothing joins them: the link is a comment in `retention/mod.rs` saying "`get_versions` is `published_at ASC`; rank 0 must be the newest". A deliberate reordering that updated the adapter's own test would leave retention silently deleting the newest N, so this is the test that records the dependency. |
//! | The pin is durable | `set_retention_keep` is an `UPDATE` and `retention_keep` is a column `get_versions` decodes. §13.8 calls the pin "phase 3's most important safety property"; nothing exercised its SQL. |
//! | `dry_run` writes nothing | §10 asks for this "by counting rows *and stored objects* before and after, then running live and comparing against the report". The core test counts rows in a `Vec` against a storage double whose `delete` returns `Ok(true)` without doing anything. |
//!
//! Tombstone mechanics — that a reclamation spends the coordinate, that the row
//! survives, that a republish is refused — belong to `delete_version` and are
//! asserted in `pg_tombstones.rs`. This file asserts that the *run* reaches them.
