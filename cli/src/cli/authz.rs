//! `batlehub authz` — why the resolver decided that.
//!
//! RFC 0015 §4.8. Every mechanism the RFC removes had its own way of being
//! invisible, and *"the only way to answer 'why was this refused?' was to read
//! Rust."* §4.8 puts this command beside the console page for a specific reason:
//! *"The same data is available to `batlehub authz explain` … so this is not a
//! reason to open a browser."*
//!
//! # Why the output leads with provenance
//!
//! A resolved set without provenance tells an operator *what* a subject holds.
//! Naming the tier **and the subject form** that produced each verb tells them
//! **which line to edit** — which §4.8 calls the difference between a debugging
//! tool and a diagnostic. So `granted_by` is a column rather than a detail
//! behind `--json`.
