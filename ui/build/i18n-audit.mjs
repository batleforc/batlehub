/**
 * Report user-visible text that is still hardcoded in templates.
 *
 * The RFC calls for a lint gate that "fails on literal user-visible text in
 * templates, so the catalogue cannot silently rot as pages are added". That gate
 * is only honest once the extraction is finished — turning it on mid-migration
 * would mean a permanently red build that everyone learns to ignore, which is
 * worse than no gate at all.
 *
 * So this reports by default and fails only with `--max <n>`, letting the
 * remaining count be ratcheted down as surfaces are converted, and pinned at 0
 * when Phase 8 closes.
 *
 *   node build/i18n-audit.mjs           # report
 *   node build/i18n-audit.mjs --max 0   # gate
 *
 * Four places text hides, because it reached zero while three of them were
 * unscanned and most of the console was still English:
 *
 *   1. text nodes                  `<th>Registry</th>`
 *   2. human-facing attributes     `title="Dashboard"`, `label="Registries"`
 *   3. literals in expressions     `{{ busy ? 'Loading…' : 'Refresh' }}`
 *   4. literals in `<script>`      `{ label: "All Packages" }`
 *
 * (1) missed every single capitalised word, because the "is this an identifier"
 * test was case-insensitive and unanchored to spaces, so `Registries` and `You`
 * read as identifiers. (2) covered four HTML attributes but no component prop.
 * (3) could not see anything, because attribute values are blanked before the
 * tag split and interpolations are stripped. (4) was out of scope entirely,
 * which is how the whole admin navigation stayed English behind a green gate.
 *
 * It stays conservative about what counts as prose: identifiers, numbers, code,
 * single symbols, Tailwind class lists and the domain terms §4.6 keeps verbatim
 * are all skipped. A gate nobody can drive to zero is a gate nobody reads.

     Error ? e.message : "Export failed"` is an assignment whose right-hand side
     is an expression, so the assignment sink above cannot see it, and it is the
     shape every "…or a default message" line takes.

     `:` is in the alternation because the *else* branch is where the default
     sits: the `?` branch carries the value that was found and the `:` branch
     the sentence somebody wrote for when it was not. Without it this pass read
     the half of the ternary that is never the hardcoded one, which is how
     seven `: "Unknown error"` fallbacks sat behind a zero.

     It cannot be matched blind, because `label: "Registries"` is the same two
     characters. A `:` preceded by a bare identifier is left to the
     object-literal pass below, which already reports it under the key's name —
     the point is not to hide it here but to count it once, in one place.

     The `:` branch alone demands a space before the literal and refuses a
     *preceding* `:`, because a colon is the one operator here that also occurs
     *inside* strings. `` `${registry}::` `` ends in two of them, and a colon
     glued to the template's own closing backtick pairs with the *next* backtick
     in the file — five lines of `_store.delete(k)` were reported as an
     untranslated sentence. Formatting puts a space after a ternary's colon and
     never after a namespace separator, so that space is what tells a colon
     between two expressions from a colon inside one string. It is also why the
     following colon needs no guard of its own: `\s` cannot match one.

     All three operators sit in one alternation, and the pass is one scan, on
     purpose. Read as two loops — `??`/`||`/`?` in one, `:` in the other — each
     regex is simpler and the result is wrong: a second independent scan
     re-reads what the first already consumed, and the `?` ending
     `"…</span>?", confirmLabel:` pairs with the quote after it to report
     `, confirmLabel:` as English. One scan cannot overlap itself. */
