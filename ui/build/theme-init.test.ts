/**
 * The pre-paint theme script, run as a browser would run it.
 *
 * `tokens.css` makes dark the default and light opt-in through
 * `[data-theme="light"]`, and nothing set that attribute until `useColorMode`
 * mounted — so every reader on a light preference saw a full page of near-black
 * first, for as long as it took to fetch and parse the bundle.
 *
 * This file exists for one reason beyond checking the resolution: the script
 * and `useColorMode` run milliseconds apart over the same storage key, and if
 * they ever disagree about an input the reader gets a *second* flash at mount —
 * the same defect moved rather than removed. So the cases below are the ones
 * where the two could drift, and each is written against what `@vueuse/core`
 * actually does, read from `useColorMode` in the installed package:
 *
 *     const modes = { auto: "", light: "light", dark: "dark", ... }
 *     const system = computed(() => preferredDark.value ? "dark" : "light")
 *     const state  = computed(() => store.value === "auto" ? system.value : store.value)
 *     el.setAttribute(attribute, modes[mode] ?? mode)
 *
 * and `usePreferredDark` is `useMediaQuery("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")`,
 * whose `matches` ref starts at `false` and stays there when `matchMedia` is
 * unavailable.

 * file under vitest's jsdom — so it declares what it needs instead of widening
