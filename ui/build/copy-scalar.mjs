// Copy the Scalar API-reference bundle into the build output, so `/scalar` is
// served from this origin instead of a CDN.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// `utoipa-scalar`'s stock template loads
// `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@scalar/api-reference` — unversioned, so it
// executed whatever was newest at request time, on the same origin the console
// keeps its bearer and refresh tokens on. Pinning the URL and adding an SRI hash
// fixed the integrity half. This removes the dependency itself:
//
//   * a private registry is frequently run with no egress at all, and `/scalar`
//     was simply a blank page there;
//   * every load leaked the operator's IP and referrer to a third party;
//   * the bundle's own supply chain (25 direct dependencies, ~190 transitive)
//     was invisible to `pnpm audit`, postmortem and the SBOM. As a declared
//     devDependency it is now covered by all three — that code was always
//     shipped to the browser, it just was not declared.
//
// The bundle still calls `api.scalar.com` on load; those URLs are hardcoded and
// ignore the `apiBaseUrl` setting. `connect-src 'self'` in the server's
// `API_DOCS_CSP` is what stops them, and self-hosting does not change that.
//
// # Which artifact
//
// `dist/browser/standalone.js` — the self-contained IIFE. Not
// `standalone.esm.js`, which is smaller only because it code-splits into
// `chunks/` and would need every chunk copied and a `type="module"` tag.
