 * The gate's own regression signal.
 *
 * `pnpm run i18n:check` reported `0 untranslated strings across 0 files` while
 * five English strings rendered to a French operator, and it had reported the
 * same zero once before while the *entire admin navigation* was in English. Both
 * times the scanner was correct about everything it looked at and silent about
 * where the text actually was.
 *
 * So the assertions here are about what the scanner can *see*, not about the
 * current count. A count of zero over a tree proves nothing unless something
 * independently proves a non-zero is reachable — which is exactly the property
 * RFC 0004-bis §2 says four of our gates were missing.
