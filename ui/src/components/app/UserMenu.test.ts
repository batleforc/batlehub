/**
 * The menu is the console's only home for surfaces demoted out of the primary
 * bar, which makes "is it actually listed here" a correctness question rather
 * than a cosmetic one.
 *
 * RFC 0003 removed `/tools` from the primary nav on the stated grounds that
 * diagnostics stay "reachable from the user menu" (`config/navigation.ts`), and
 * `config/navigation.test.ts` pins the removal for all three viewers. The other
 * half was never written: no entry existed here, so the two tool routes were
 * reachable only by typing a URL or from `PackageDetailPage`'s denial link. The
 * removal had a gate; the promise that justified it had none — which is the
 * shape RFC 0004-bis §2 is about.
