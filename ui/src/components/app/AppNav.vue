/**
 * The primary bar, cut to the design proof's segment grammar
 * (`ui/design-proof/index.html`, `.masthead nav`).
 *
 * The cells share one bounding box and are divided by the rule, rather than
 * floating as separate rounded pills: the box is what says "these three are one
 * choice". The chosen cell reverses to a solid ink block — the same reversal
 * the proof's `.segmented` control uses for a pressed option, so a selection
 * reads identically wherever it appears. That reversal is the component's one
 * contrast event and it costs no scanning room; the previous tinted fill was
 * carrying the state on `bg-accent`, which The Undependable Fill Rule says is
 * not a state channel at all (it resolves to `--ground-raised`, 1.06:1).
 *
 * Admin keeps its copper ink while unchosen — that signal is the app's, not the
 * proof's, and it survives the re-cut because it rides on ink, not on fill.
