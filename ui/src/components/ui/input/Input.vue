 * announced its placeholder instead of its label. The bulk page's reason field
 * announced "CVE-2025-XXXX or policy violation"; the token page's name field
 * announced "e.g. CI pipeline". Both in English, to a French screen-reader
 * user, over a label that was translated and correct.
 *
 * A placeholder is still better than no name at all, so it stays for a field
 * that has neither a label, a `labelledby`, nor an `aria-label` of its own —
 * but it now yields to every one of them.
