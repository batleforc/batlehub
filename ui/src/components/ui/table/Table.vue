    The scroll container is focusable, and has to be. A region that scrolls but
    cannot be reached by keyboard is unreachable content for anyone not using a
    pointer — axe reports it as `scrollable-region-focusable`, and RFC 0003
    §4.7 makes tables keyboard-operable explicitly. `tabindex="0"` puts it in
    the tab order so arrow keys can scroll it; `role="region"` plus a name is
    what makes it announce as something worth stopping on rather than as an
    anonymous focus stop.

    This is also the Own-Container Overflow Rule's container: wide content
    scrolls here so the body never scrolls sideways.

    SonarCloud flags the `tabindex` here ("should only be declared on
    interactive elements") and is wrong: its rule has no exception for scroll
    containers, and removing the attribute trades a heuristic finding for a real
    WCAG 2.1.1 failure that axe catches. Web:S6845 is ignored for this one file
    in sonar-project.properties, with the reasoning there — a per-issue
    resolution in the UI does not survive the next branch that touches this file,
    which is how the finding came back. See
    docs/internal/sonar-triage-2026-08-30.md. Do not "fix" it.
