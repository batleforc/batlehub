/**
 * Resolution as State — DESIGN.md's organising idea, and the system's signature.
 *
 * "What BatleHub holds and has verified renders at full resolution; what it does
 * not renders coarse." A fine 3×3 matrix of 5px cells means held and verified; a
 * coarse 2×2 of 8px cells means it is not. The count of lit cells and the hue
 * then say *which* not-held state it is.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a component and not as a page's markup
 *
 * DESIGN.md specified it, `ui/design-proof/index.html` implements it, and
 * `ui/src` had it nowhere — for two RFCs. RFC 0004-bis §7 item 7 and §2.7 found
 * that independently, from opposite directions: a Phase 5 reviewer reading admin
 * pages, and a direct measurement of `/packages` against the proof it was built
 * from. The conclusion both reached was that it must land **once**, as one shared
 * component, rather than being invented per page — which is how the console
 * ended up with eleven crimson row-verbs and two `<datalist>` improvisations.
 *
 * ## Three channels, never one
 *
 * DESIGN.md: "Never colour alone — pattern, word and hue all carry it." So the
 * matrix is `aria-hidden` and *always* accompanied by its word: the pattern
 * carries it for a monochrome display, the word for a screen reader, the hue for
 * everyone else. `label` is required for that reason; there is no variant of
 * this component that renders the dots on their own.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * The `resolve` animation (520ms, `cubic-bezier(.16, 1, .3, 1)`). DESIGN.md is
 * emphatic that it plays "on rows that have just arrived or just changed state —
 * never on load of unchanged content, never on hover, never on more than the
 * rows that changed". A component cannot know which of those it is in; only the
 * list rendering it can. Putting the animation here would make it fire on every
 * render, which is the one thing the spec forbids by name.
