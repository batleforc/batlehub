           3:1 that WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a boundary that is the only thing

           than reinvented: a confirmation is full ink against a rule that
           carries more weight, not a fifth hue.

           It exists because `--destructive` resolves to `--accent`
           (`assets/index.css`), so `default` and `destructive` paint the same
           crimson. `AccessCheck` — the page whose entire job is to answer "was
           I allowed?" — rendered both answers in it, and `BadgeVariant` had no
           member that meant "known".

           `border-border`, not `border-rule-strong`: `--border` *is*
           `--rule-strong`, and there is no `--color-rule-strong` in `@theme`,
           so the latter would compile to nothing and quietly ship a
           borderless badge. It differs from `outline` on the ink — full
           `--ink` rather than `--ink-dim` — because an answer is not the same
           thing as a neutral label. */
