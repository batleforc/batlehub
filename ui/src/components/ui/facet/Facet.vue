 * One cell, two orientations — a rail from `md` up, a scrolling row below it.
 *
 * This is the design proof's own answer to the narrow viewport
 * (`@media (max-width:900px)`: `.bay ul{display:flex;overflow-x:auto}`,
 * `.bay a{white-space:nowrap;border-left:0;border-bottom:2px solid transparent}`).
 * The page had been hiding the bay outright below `md`, which left a phone with
 * no way to change registry at all: the filter existed, the control did not.
 *
 * The lit edge rotates with the layout — left border in the rail, bottom border
 * in the row — because in a horizontal strip a left border reads as a divider
 * between neighbours rather than as a mark on the chosen one. What does *not*
 * change is that selection rides on ink and a 1px edge: at this palette's
 * lightness a fill step measures ~1.06:1 against the ground, so `bg-secondary`
 * stays a secondary cue in both orientations (The Undependable Fill Rule).
 *
 * Held as one string rather than repeated on both buttons: the "all" option and
 * a registry option drifting apart is exactly the kind of difference nobody
 * notices until one of them stops looking selected.
