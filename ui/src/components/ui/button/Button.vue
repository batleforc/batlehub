/**
 * `disabled:opacity-50` is *not* on the shared base.
 *
 * It was, and it dimmed every variant uniformly — including the two crimson
 * fills, which kept their fill underneath. DESIGN.md is explicit that the
 * primary "disabled drops the fill entirely and becomes a dim outlined
 * control (crimson never appears in a disabled state)", and §Colour repeats
 * it: "don't let it appear in a disabled control".
 *
 * So the filled variants drop their fill and become the outlined control the
 * rule describes — `--ink-dim` on a `--rule-strong` boundary, 5.62:1 in dark
 * and 7.24:1 in light with a 3.68:1/3.41:1 border. The unfilled ones take the
 * `opacity: .5` DESIGN.md gives the secondary control, per variant rather than
 * from one shared string that could not tell them apart.

           the button displaces sideways and leaves two stacked plates behind
           it, like a mis-registered print pull. Both are zero-blur.

           The ring *is* the hover. `hover:bg-primary/85` also sat here, and
           dimming crimson toward a near-black ground takes `--accent-ink` on
           it from 5.69:1 to 4.28:1 — under the AA floor, on the label of the
           one filled action in the product, in the state a pointer is in when
           it is about to click. DESIGN.md never asked for it: it specifies the
           ring and the pixel step and nothing about the fill. */

           `--accent` — so it takes the same hover for the same reason, rather
           than the fill dim that measured the same 4.28:1. */

        /* DESIGN.md's "Secondary — the control" (`.ctl`), transcribed from the
           rule and from `ui/design-proof/index.html:186-191`, which implements
           it: transparent, 1px `--rule-strong`, `--ink-dim` text; hover lifts
           the text to `--ink` and the border to `--ink-dim`; `aria-pressed`
           lifts the text and turns the border copper.

           It was crimson at 40% — `border-primary/40 text-primary` — which is
           not what the system specifies for this control and did not measure:
           1.70:1 in dark and 2.14:1 in light for the boundary of an
           interactive element, against the 3:1 of WCAG 1.4.11.

           The hover went with it, and had to. `hover:bg-accent` resolves to
           `--surface-hover`, which is `--ground-raised`, which `tokens.css`
           annotates as "1.06:1 — confirmation, not elevation": the fill was
           imperceptible, so the *only* thing that marked a hover was the
           border going `/40` to `/70`. Making the resting border opaque would
           have taken that away and left the control with no hover at all.
           Lifting the ink and the border instead is two channels, both
           measurable: 3.68/3.41 to 5.62/7.24 on the boundary, 5.62/7.24 to
           16.88/16.64 on the label. */
