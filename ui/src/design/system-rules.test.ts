 * The rules that are properties of the *source* rather than of a rendering.

 * It started as two of DESIGN.md's rules about utilities, and the reason it
 * collects the rest is the same one: `tokens.test.ts` grades the token file,
 * and a component that never asks the tokens is invisible to it. A Tailwind
 * class carrying its own hardcoded value, a `confirm()` that can state no
 * scope, an irreversible action inheriting somebody else's consequence — none
 * of those is a number anything can measure, and each is exactly readable in
 * the text of the file.
 *
 * These began as **frozen lists** — an equality rather than a ceiling, so that
 * a new occurrence failed *and* clearing one failed until the number was
 * lowered in the same commit, where a reviewer could see the two together. A
 * ceiling (`<=`) would have let the list rot at its high-water mark, which is
 * the failure mode the i18n gate spent three holes demonstrating.
 *
 * Both lists are empty now. They stay written out rather than collapsed into a
 * bare `toEqual({})`, because the shape is what lets the next piece of debt be
 * recorded the same way instead of argued about.
