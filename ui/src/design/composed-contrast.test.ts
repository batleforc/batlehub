/**
 * Contrast for the pairings the component layer *composes*.
 *
 * `tokens.test.ts` measures the tokens and finds them correct — they are, all
 * of them, within ±0.09 of the ratios DESIGN.md quotes. That is the whole
 * problem: it grades `--ink-dim` against `--ground` at full opacity, and the
 * component that paints them writes `text-muted-foreground/60`. The colour a
 * reader sees is a composite that no token file contains and nothing measured,
 * and it lands at 2.59:1 against a 4.5:1 floor.
 *
 * Nine pairings are graded here. They were found by reading the class strings
 * rather than the token file, so each case records the site it came from —
 * change the alpha there and this test is what notices.
 *
 * Two kinds of case sit side by side and both belong:
 *
 *   - an **alpha composite**, where the value painted is not any token;
 *   - a pairing DESIGN.md simply **does not declare**, like `--rule-strong` on
 *     `--ground-raised` or a syntax-highlighting colour that arrives from a
 *     third-party theme rather than from the palette. Those pass today. They
 *     are locked because passing is a fact about the current numbers, and the
 *     light rendition of the first clears its floor by 0.07.

/**
 * The alpha a component actually paints with, read out of its source.
 *
 * Not a number copied into this file. A transcribed alpha makes the test a
 * snapshot of what the components said the day it was written: removing the
 * `/60` from `Input.vue` would leave this asserting 2.59:1 against a
 * placeholder that now measures 5.62:1, failing for a defect that was fixed.
 * The opposite drift is worse — a `/40` widened to `/25` would keep passing
 * against the old number.
 *
 * `pattern` must be global and must capture the percentage. A utility with no
 * `/n` suffix is opaque, which is how a fixed site reports itself.
 *
 * Two rules beyond "find the number":
 *
 *   - **Every occurrence, worst case wins.** One token is usually painted in
 *     several states — a resting fill and a hover dim, a border and its
 *     variant — and the one that matters is the weakest. Reading only the
 *     first match measured the fill a pointer is *not* on.
 *
 *   - **`dark:` belongs to one rendition.** `index.css` wires
 *     `@custom-variant dark` to `:root:not([data-theme="light"])`, so the dark
 *     rendition is the default and `dark:border-destructive` really did make
 *     `Alert`'s border opaque there while the unprefixed `/50` applied in
 *     light. Reading the two as one number reported 2.09:1 against a dark
 *     border that measured 5.76:1 — a failure in a rendition that did not have
 *     one, which is the same class of error as grading a light syntax theme
 *     against a dark ground.
