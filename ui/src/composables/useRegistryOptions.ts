/**
 * The registries this viewer can see, as `Select` options.
 *
 * RFC 0004-bis §2.8: the same concept was a closed list on one page and a
 * free-text box on another. Four fields asked an operator to type a registry
 * name — and the placeholder in each guessed a *different* convention
 * (`e.g. crates-io`, `github`, `npm`, `e.g. my-cargo`), which is what a field
 * looks like when nobody could check their answer. A registry list is a handful
 * of entries and is fetched on nearly every page already.
 *
 * `listRegistries` rather than `registryHealth`: this is role-filtered and
 * reachable by an anonymous visitor, so the public `/tools/access-check` and
 * the admin pages can share one source instead of two that must agree.
