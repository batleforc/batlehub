/**
 * RFC 0003 §13 recorded these two as deliberately *not* catalogue keys, on the
 * grounds that a misrouted API is a deployment fault an operator reads. RFC
 * 0004-bis §4.1 reverses that: the operator reading it is as likely to be
 * French as the user reading anything else, and an exemption the gate cannot
 * see is indistinguishable from a string nobody noticed. The gate runs at
 * `--max 0`, so an exemption has to be declared rather than argued in a comment.
 *
 * `i18n.global.t` rather than `useI18n()`: this file is a composable *and* a
 * module-scope helper, and `extractMessage` is called from outside `setup`.
