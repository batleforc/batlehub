/**
 * Navigation as data (RFC 0003 §4.1, §4.2).
 *
 * Two things live here that were previously scattered:
 *
 *  1. **Which links a viewer gets**, derived from their identity rather than
 *     rendered-then-hidden. A nav item is shown when the viewer can *use* it,
 *     so nothing in the bar leads to a redirect. This is a clarity rule, never
 *     an authorisation one — the router guards and the server's RBAC are what
 *     actually stop anyone, and typing the URL still hits both.
 *
 *  2. **The legacy redirect table.** These were ~20 hand-written entries in the
 *     router, added one per moved page, which is how the section list and its
 *     aliases drifted apart. One table means a moved route is one edit.
