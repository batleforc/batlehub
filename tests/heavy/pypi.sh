# Heavy PyPI integration test — twine and pip, against the real clients.
#
# RFC 0009 §12.7 found the worst defect of the whole verification here, and
# found it by accident: pip was installed, so it was cheap to try. BatleHub's
# simple-page rewrite touches `href` and nothing else, so upstream's
# `data-core-metadata` attribute survived onto our page — pip trusted it,
# requested `{file}.metadata`, got a `404`, and **did not fall back to
# downloading the wheel**. §7.6 had called PEP 658 "a silent slowdown rather
# than an error". It was a hard failure, and against real PyPI, where
# essentially every modern wheel carries the attribute, it breaks `pip install`
# outright.
#
# What this proves:
#
#   1. `twine upload` publishes to a **local** registry over the documented
#      flow — `-u __token__ -p <token>`, which is HTTP Basic, not Bearer.
#      docs/registries/pypi.md tells users to do exactly this, and nothing in
#      the repository ran it.
#   2. `pip install` from that registry gets the distribution back through the
#      simple index and the rewritten file link.
#   3. Against a **proxy** registry, pip requests the PEP 658 sibling and gets
#      it — the §12.7 regression. The assertion is on pip's own request, not on
#      a `curl` of the same URL: curl served that document perfectly throughout
#      the period the client was failing (§5.2 is a list of ways that happens).
#
# Run via `task test:pypi-heavy` or directly. Needs network: the proxy
# registry's upstream is pypi.org, and PEP 658 is upstream's advertisement.
#
# Environment knobs: DATABASE_URL (required), HEAVY_PORT (8083),
# HEAVY_TAP_PORT (8093), COVERAGE, HEAVY_PYPI_PROBE (default six==1.17.0).
