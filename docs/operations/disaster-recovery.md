# Disaster Recovery

This document describes what data lives where, how to back it up, and how to restore a BatleHub instance after a failure.

## Data inventory

| Store | What lives there | Loss impact |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| PostgreSQL | Package metadata, access events, quota, rate-limit counters, SBOM records, config change history, user/IP blocks, notification subscriptions | All package listings, audit log, and policy state lost |
| Artifact storage (S3 / filesystem) | Cached proxy artifacts and published local-mode artifacts | Cached proxy artifacts re-fetched on demand; **local-mode artifacts are permanently lost** unless a separate backup exists |
| Redis (optional) | Metadata cache, rate-limit counters (short-lived) | Harmless: server refills automatically on restart |

## Backup strategy

### PostgreSQL

Schedule `pg_dump` to a durable location (e.g. S3 bucket with versioning enabled):

```bash
pg_dump -Fc "$DATABASE_URL" > batlehub-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).pgdump
```

Recommended retention: 7 daily + 4 weekly + 12 monthly snapshots.

For WAL-based continuous backup use `pgBackRest` or `Barman`. Point-in-time recovery allows you to restore to any second, not just snapshot boundaries.

### Artifact storage

**S3:** Enable S3 versioning on the bucket and configure lifecycle rules to retain deleted objects for 30 days. Use Cross-Region Replication for a warm standby.

**Filesystem:** Run `rclone sync` to a remote destination on a schedule, e.g.:

```bash
rclone sync /var/lib/batlehub/artifacts s3:my-backup-bucket/batlehub-artifacts \
  --transfers 16 --checksum
```

## Restore procedure

### Scenario 1 — DB corruption or accidental table drop

1. Stop all BatleHub instances to prevent further writes.
2. Create a fresh database: `createdb batlehub`.
3. Restore: `pg_restore -d batlehub batlehub-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.pgdump`.
4. Restart BatleHub — it will run migrations automatically on startup.
5. Verify with `batlehub-cli registry list`.

### Scenario 2 — S3 bucket lost (cached artifacts only, no local-mode)

This is survivable with no data loss for proxy-mode registries. Cached artifacts are re-fetched from upstream on the next request.

1. Create a new bucket, update `[storage] bucket` in config.
2. Trigger a config reload: `batlehub-cli admin config reload`.
3. Optionally pre-warm critical packages: `batlehub-cli admin cache warm <registry> --packages <name>`.

### Scenario 3 — S3 bucket lost (local-mode artifacts present)

Local-mode artifacts are not re-fetchable. Without a bucket backup, those artifacts are gone.

1. If a bucket backup exists: restore with `rclone sync s3:my-backup-bucket/batlehub-artifacts /restore/`.
2. Point the new bucket at the restored data, or configure filesystem storage pointing at the restored path.
3. Restart BatleHub.

Without a backup, re-publish the affected artifacts using `batlehub-cli publish` or the registry-specific client.

### Scenario 4 — Full disaster (DB + storage lost)

1. Provision a new Postgres instance and restore from the latest `pg_dump`.
2. Provision a new storage backend and restore from the artifact backup.
3. Deploy BatleHub with the restored DB URL and storage config.
4. Run `batlehub-cli admin cache warm` for each registry to avoid a cold-start miss storm.

## Cross-region failover

BatleHub supports active/passive failover with a read replica and a standby storage bucket:

1. **Promote the replica DB**: `pg_ctl promote` (Postgres 12+) or use the managed-DB failover UI.
2. **Switch the storage bucket**: update `[storage] bucket` to the replica region bucket (populated by CRR).
3. **Update DNS** to point `batlehub.example.com` at the standby region.
4. **Restart** BatleHub instances in the standby region.

Expected RTO with a pre-warmed standby: < 5 minutes. RPO depends on replication lag (typically seconds for WAL streaming, minutes for scheduled pg_dump).

## Pending publish orphans

If a BatleHub process dies during a publish, the `local_packages` table may contain rows with `status = 'pending'`. These are cleaned up automatically by the background `spawn_pending_publish_cleanup` task (hourly by default). To clean up immediately:

```sql
DELETE FROM local_packages WHERE status = 'pending' AND created_at < now() - interval '2 hours';
```

Or trigger via the API: restart the server (the task runs on startup tick after the first interval).

## Runbook checklist

- [ ] Postgres backup job runs daily, retention ≥ 7 days
- [ ] S3 versioning enabled on artifact bucket
- [ ] Artifact rclone sync runs at least hourly for local-mode registries
- [ ] Recovery procedure tested quarterly (restore to staging)
- [ ] Alert on backup job failure (e.g. CloudWatch, Prometheus alertmanager)
- [ ] `deploy/prometheus-alerts.yaml` loaded — `BatleHubDown` alert active
