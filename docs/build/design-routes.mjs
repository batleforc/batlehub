/**
 * The documentation site's rendered design gate (RFC 0005 §10, phase 4).
 *
 * Until this existed, `impeccable detect ui/src website/.vitepress` was the
 * site's entire design coverage: a *static source* scan. The console has had a
 * rendered gate since RFC 0003 — axe plus the type ramp and the display face,
 * over 30 route/role pairs at two viewports — and the surface every prospective
 * user actually sees had nothing measured in a browser at all.
 *
 * This is the console's `ui/build/design-routes.mjs` pointed at a static site,
 * with the differences that follow from that: there is no session to seed, so
 * the route list is not a hand-maintained array but *every page in the build*,
 * read off `.vitepress/dist`. A page that is added and never listed anywhere is
 * exactly the page that drifts, so the list cannot be a list.
 *
 *   node build/design-routes.mjs                 # every page, every plan
 *   node build/design-routes.mjs --survey        # report, never fail
 *   ROUTES=/,/guide/installation.html node build/design-routes.mjs
 *
 * It talks to an already-running Chrome over CDP (`puppeteer-core`, so no
 * second browser is downloaded) — in this workspace, the `che-browser` sidecar.
 * BASE points at a `vitepress preview` of the build under test.
 *
 * ── What this gate cannot see ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both of these were found by asking why it had passed the config generator
 * while that page carried a colour measuring 4.15:1. Neither is a bug in the
 * script; both are limits worth stating, because a gate whose blind spots are
 * undocumented gets trusted for things it never checked.
 *
 * 1. ONE STATE PER PAGE — closed, for the one page it applied to. Every page is
 *    loaded once, in whatever state it opens in, and for prose that is the
 *    whole page. `/guide/config-generator` is a form, and its preview only
 *    emits the token classes the current form state produces: with the defaults
 *    there are twelve `.cg-hl-bracket` spans and *zero* `.cg-hl-comment`, which
 *    is where the failing colour was hiding. `SEEDS` below now drives that page
 *    before measuring it, and asserts the classes it meant to produce actually
 *    appeared. Verified by reintroducing the colour: the gate reports
 *    `4.15:1 (#6e7781 on #faf3f3)` at 1440·light, where it used to report
 *    nothing. Any *other* page whose appearance depends on interaction is still
 *    measured in its opening state — the mechanism exists, the entry does not.
 *
 * 2. AXE SKIPS PUNCTUATION-ONLY TEXT. `color-contrast` returns no verdict at
 *    all — not a pass, not an incomplete — for a node whose visible text has no
 *    word characters. Proven by swapping one span's text on a live page and
 *    changing nothing else: `"["` gets no verdict, `"section"` is judged at
 *    4.74:1. A syntax highlighter is mostly brackets and equals signs, so a
 *    large share of its tokens are invisible to the contrast rule.
 *
 * The ramp and material assertions below have neither limit — they walk every
 * element with its own text, whatever that text is. It is specifically the
 * contrast half that is axe's, and axe's rules are axe's.

   Pages that have to be driven before they are worth measuring.

   Limit 1 in the header above: a page is loaded once, in the state it opens in.
   For every page on this site that is prose, that is the whole page. For the
   config generator it is not — it is a form, and its output pane only emits the
   token classes the current form state produces. With the defaults it renders
   twelve `.cg-hl-bracket` spans and zero `.cg-hl-comment`, which is how a
   colour measuring 4.15:1 sat in it behind a green gate.

   So the generator gets driven first. Each seed returns the selectors it means
   to have produced, and the gate fails if they are still absent — a seed that
   silently stops working would restore the blind spot it exists to close,
   which is the failure mode RFC 0003 named when six console pages reported
   clean while none of them had rendered.
